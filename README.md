# CLIP Prompt Engineering and Ensemble with PyTorch

This repository offers a PyTorch implementation of OpenAI's CLIP model, specifically focusing on prompt engineering and ensemble techniques to enhance zero-shot image classification. We delve into prompt engineering strategy and showcase how aggregating predictions from multiple prompts can significantly elevate classification accuracy.

A detailed breakdown of the code and the techniques employed can be found in our Medium article: [Prompt Ensemble in Zero-Shot Classification Using CLIP](https://medium.com/@satojkovic/prompt-ensemble-in-zero-shot-classification-using-clip-e8e1b7b23bb1)
